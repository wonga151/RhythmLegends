# Rhythm Legends
A simple Rhythm game developed to learn Unity, where the player tries to press buttons according to the bpm of a song within pre-generated beatmap. 
Game logic, player interactions, and screen behavior written in C#.
Exported 3D character model and animations, from the game League of Legends, into Blender to modify keyframes for transitioning model animations smoothly, and converted the results into 2D for Unity.
